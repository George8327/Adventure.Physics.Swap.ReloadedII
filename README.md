# Supported Games

- Sonic Adventure DX (2004, US Release)
- Sonic Adventure 2\* (Steam)
- Sonic Heroes

\* Must be stripped from DRM using [Steamless](https://github.com/atom0s/Steamless). Reloaded II does not currently have the ability to decrypt Steam DRM executables. Alternatively inject Reloaded after starting the game or load asynchronously using an external loader using the methods described [here](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/blob/master/Docs/InjectionMethods.md#auto-inject--inject). 

# Features

- Semi-realtime physics editing and swapping. 
  - SADX/SA2: Re-enter level for changes to take effect.
  - Heroes: Switch leader. 
  - Will consider true realtime editing if it's a requested feature.
- Easy to use, fancy GUI. 

# Usage

- Install mod like a regular Reloaded II mod.
- Run `Config.exe` to setup mod configuration.
- Run the game.

Semi-realtime editing is supported (see above).
